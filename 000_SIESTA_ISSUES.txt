Siesta plugin issues

-- The CML file stores forces at each geometry iteration, but not the
   stress. Trajectories (not implemented yet) will then contain only
   positions and forces.

-- I do not know how to deal with the "restart" capability.

-- Band structures are fundamentally different from BZ
   sampling. K-point specification is different. Not implemented yet.

-- Units are now given in XX_units entries, but the XX itself might
   not be standard.

-- Basis-set info is now dealt with as a special set of parameters.

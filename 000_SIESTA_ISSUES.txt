Siesta plugin issues

-- Trajectories are not implemented yet

-- K-point sampling for the scf cycle follows Siesta convention: the
   absence of a 'kpoints' node implies gamma-point sampling.
   
-- Band structure processing is still a bit fragile (work in progress)
      
-- Units are now given in XX_units entries, but the XX itself might
   not be standard.

-- Basis-set info is now dealt with as a special set of parameters,
   but in raw form, which is not easily subject to queries.

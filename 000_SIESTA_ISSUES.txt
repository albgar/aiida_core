Siesta plugin issues

-- The output structure will not use the right names, only the element
   names. This can be fixed at the CML level, or, more robustly, by
   reusing the input structure and changing only the site positions.

-- The CML file stores forces at each geometry iteration, but not the
   stress. Trajectories will then contain only positions and forces.

-- I do not know how to deal with the "restart" capability.

-- Band structures are fundamentally different from BZ
   sampling. K-point specification is different. Not implemented yet.

Siesta plugin issues

-- The CML file stores forces at each geometry iteration, but not the
   stress. Trajectories (not implemented yet) will then contain only
   positions and forces.

-- I do not know how to deal with the "restart" capability.

-- Band structures are fundamentally different from BZ
   sampling. K-point specification is different. Not implemented yet.
   Suggested solution:
   The user should define in input bandskpoints, a KpontsData
   structure containing information on the kpoints where to calculate bands.
   !!!bandskpoints.set_cell(..,..) HAS ALWAYS TO BE SET, OTHERWISE PARSINGFAIL!!!
   !!!  (THIS SHOULD BE IMPROVED, AT LEAST I SHOULD PUT AN ERROR MESSAGE)     !!!
   Distinction between BandLines and BandPoints is automatically done
   looking for labels in bandskpoints: I assume it's reasonable to expect 
   some labels (Gamma, X, L, ...) when you define a line, no labels for points.
   File /example/submission/siesta_cif_bands.py sould help to understand.
   Another possibility would be to set a flag in input.
   BandLinesScale ReciprocalLatticeVectors is always set.
   Bands are stored using the already implemented BandsData class and parsed
   reading the ASCI file .bands (we have to discuss about .xml).
   You can easly export bands in various formats. Be aware that kpoints
   in siesta file .bands are in 2*pi/A where A in bohr, while
   in aiida A is in Ang (a factor 1.889725989 of difference).
   Kpoints for bands are stored twice, but it's the same for QuantumEspresso.
   
-- Units are now given in XX_units entries, but the XX itself might
   not be standard.

-- Basis-set info is now dealt with as a special set of parameters.

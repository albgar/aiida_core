Siesta Plugin limitations
-------------------------

* TranSiesta not supported

* Trajectories are not implemented yet, so MD features
  are not really supported.

* DOS and Partial DOS, Mulliken, Voronoi, Hirshfeld charges not
  yet supported.

* Wavefunction tagging and storage for further processing not
  yet supported.
  
* Modern-theory of polarization features not supported
  
* Zmatrix spec and optimization not supported
  (for fundamental reasons)
  
* Basis-set specification is not easily searchable

* Band structure recording for non-spin-polarized calculations
  exhibits a bug (hopefully to be fixed very soon)

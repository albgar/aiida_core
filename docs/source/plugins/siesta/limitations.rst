Siesta Plugin limitations
-------------------------

* TranSiesta not supported

* Trajectories are not implemented yet, so MD features
  are not really supported.

* Modern-theory of polarization features not supported
  (should be easy to parse the output)
  
* Zmatrix spec and optimization not supported
  (for fundamental reasons)
  
* Basis-set specification is not easily searchable
